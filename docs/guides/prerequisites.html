        <section class="content-card">
          <h2>1. Business Central environment readiness</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Confirm you are running Dynamics 365 Business Central online (version 23 or later) in
              the production or sandbox environment where BC2Fabric will synchronize data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Install the BC2Fabric extension from Microsoft AppSource and assign it to the
              companies that will publish telemetry and application data to Fabric.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a dedicated Business Central user (service account) with the BC2Fabric user
              group or equivalent permissions to read the target tables and system events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verify that the environment time zone, job queue frequency, and data retention meet
              the synchronization requirements outlined in the installation checklist.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Microsoft Entra ID application registration</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Register a single-tenant application in Microsoft Entra ID to represent BC2Fabric and
              capture the application (client) ID and directory (tenant) ID.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a client secret that will be shared with the BC2Fabric workload and note its
              expiration date for future rotations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grant the application delegated permissions for Dynamics 365 Business Central, Azure
              Key Vault, and any auxiliary APIs required by your deployment. Admin consent is needed
              before installation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the service account as an application user within Business Central, mapping it to
              the BC2Fabric permission set.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Azure Key Vault configuration</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Provision an Azure Key Vault in the same tenant that hosts Business Central and
              Microsoft Fabric.
            </li>
            <li>
              Store the BC2Fabric client secret and any integration credentials (for example, SQL or
              storage account keys) as individual secrets following a consistent naming convention.
            </li>
            <li>
              Configure access policies so that the BC2Fabric managed identity and operations team
              can retrieve secrets while limiting write access to administrators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable purge protection and soft-delete to safeguard credentials from accidental
              removal during lifecycle operations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Microsoft Fabric capacity and workspace</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure your tenant has a Fabric capacity (F64 or higher is recommended for production)
              with available resources to run the BC2Fabric pipelines and lakehouse refreshes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create or select a dedicated workspace that will host the BC2Fabric assets. The
              workspace admin should match the owner of the Entra ID application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assign the BC2Fabric service principals and operations staff as workspace members with
              contributor or higher roles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Validate data region compliance requirements when selecting the capacity and workspace
              locations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Network and security prerequisites</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Allow outbound connections from Business Central and Fabric to the BC2Fabric API
              endpoints and to Azure storage services used for staging.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review conditional access policies and multifactor prompts that might block automated
              authentication for the BC2Fabric service accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Document firewall exceptions for on-premises data gateways if they are part of your
              data export strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capture audit requirements and retention policies so the Fabric workspace can be
              configured with the correct data lake storage and monitoring integrations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Deployment checklist</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Gather tenant ID, application ID, client secret name, and key vault URI prior to
              starting the installer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Confirm Business Central companies enabled for BC2Fabric have job queues running and
              that administrators can schedule updates during off-peak hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure Fabric workspace roles, lakehouse storage accounts, and pipelines are named per
              your organization's governance policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plan for post-install validation by identifying dashboards or SQL endpoints that will
              consume the synchronized Business Central data.
            </li>
          </ul>
